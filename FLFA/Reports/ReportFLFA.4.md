Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) is a specific representation of context-free grammars (CFGs) that simplifies the parsing process and is particularly useful in various computational linguistics and computer science applications. A context-free grammar consists of a set of variables (non-terminal symbols), a set of terminals (terminal symbols), a start symbol, and a set of productions (rules) that define how variables can be replaced by sequences of terminals and other variables.

A context-free grammar is said to be in Chomsky Normal Form if all its production rules satisfy the following conditions:

A production is of the form A -> BC, where A, B, and C are variables (non-terminal symbols). B and C cannot be the start symbol.

A production is of the form A -> a, where A is a variable and a is a terminal symbol (a single character or symbol).

If the grammar allows generating an empty string (ε), there is a production of the form S -> ε, where S is the start symbol, and it is the only production with S on the right-hand side.

CNF has some useful properties:

Simplification: CFGs in CNF have a simplified structure, making parsing algorithms more efficient and easier to implement.

Binary branching: In CNF, each production rule has at most two variables on the right-hand side, which ensures binary branching. This structure simplifies the implementation of parsing algorithms, such as the CYK algorithm and Earley parser.

Elimination of ε-productions, unit productions, and useless symbols: The conversion process to CNF includes the removal of ε-productions (productions that generate empty strings), unit productions (productions with a single variable on the right-hand side), and useless symbols (symbols that do not contribute to generating terminal strings).

Unique parse trees: CNF ensures that there is only one parse tree for each valid string generated by the grammar, which simplifies the process of determining the structure of the parsed sentence.

Every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar in Chomsky Normal Form. The conversion process typically involves several steps, such as removing ε-productions, unit productions, and useless symbols, and converting production rules to the specific forms allowed in CNF.

## Steps of converting CFG to CNF
To convert a context-free grammar (CFG) to Chomsky Normal Form (CNF), follow these steps:

1. Remove ε-productions: Replace nullable variables in other productions and remove ε-productions.
2. Remove unit productions: Replace unit productions with equivalent non-unit productions.
3. Remove useless symbols: Eliminate unreachable and nonproductive symbols.
4. Convert remaining productions: Replace terminals in mixed productions with new variables, and break long productions into binary productions using new variables.

## Objectives:
1. Understand what lexical analysis is.
2. Get familiar with the inner workings of a lexer/scanner/tokenizer.
3. Implement a sample lexer and show how it works.

## Implementation description
There is a class Converter which converts given CFG to CNF. Here is short description for each method used:
**remove_inaccessible_symbols:** Eliminates variables and productions that cannot be reached from the start symbol. This helps simplify the grammar by removing unused variables and productions.

**remove_epsilon_productions:** Removes ε-productions (productions that generate an empty string) by replacing nullable variables in other productions and updating the grammar accordingly. This step is necessary to convert the grammar into CNF.

**remove_nonproductive_symbols:** Removes nonproductive variables and their productions. Nonproductive variables are those that cannot generate terminal strings. This step simplifies the grammar by removing variables that do not contribute to valid derivations.

**remove_unit_productions:** Eliminates unit productions (productions with a single variable on the right side) by replacing them with equivalent non-unit productions. This step ensures that the grammar only contains CNF-compliant productions.

**to_cnf:** Converts the remaining productions to Chomsky Normal Form by replacing terminals in mixed productions with new variables and breaking long productions into binary productions using new variables. This step transforms the grammar into its final CNF representation.

**cfg_to_cnf:** Executes the transformation process by calling the aforementioned methods in the appropriate order, converting the original CFG into CNF.

**print_cnf_productions**: Prints the resulting CNF grammar's variables, terminals, and productions in a human-readable format.
