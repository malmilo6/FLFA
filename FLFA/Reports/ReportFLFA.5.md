# Topic: Parser & Building an Abstract Syntax Tree

### Course: Formal Languages & Finite Automata
### Author: Cernetchi Maxim

## Objectives:
1. Get familiar with parsing, what it is and how it can be programmed [1].
2. Get familiar with the concept of AST [2].
3. In addition to what has been done in the 3rd lab work do the following:
   1. In case you didn't have a type that denotes the possible types of tokens you need to:
      1. Have a type __*TokenType*__ (like an enum) that can be used in the lexical analysis to categorize the tokens. 
      2. Please use regular expressions to identify the type of the token.
   2. Implement the necessary data structures for an AST that could be used for the text you have processed in the 3rd lab work.
   3. Implement a simple parser program that could extract the syntactic information from the input text.
